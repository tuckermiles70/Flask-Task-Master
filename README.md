# Flask-Task-Master

My walk-through of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA) Flask tutorial while comparing a couple web frameworks for Python. Looking for a lighweight framework for a simple project, and I've decided on using Flask. I used Django a bit, and it has way, way more than what I would need for what I plan to do. In my case, Flask will work perfect since it's lightweight and simple to use!

Below is a brief walkthrough of this basic create, read, update, and delete application

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./screencaps/1.png" /></div>

You can easily add tasks:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./screencaps/2.png" /></div>

Simply update them:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./screencaps/3.png" /></div>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./screencaps/4.png" /></div>

And lastly delete them!

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./screencaps/5.png" /></div>
